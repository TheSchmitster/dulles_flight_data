Outbound flights from Dulles International with the dependant variable if the flight gets delayed or not.

This project looks at outbound flights from Dulles International Airport for the calandar year of 2016. 
We are looking at if the flight was delayed or not, the model is trained on the number of minutes late or early that the flight
arrived to its final destination. The model was then transformed into its categorical counterpart which was used for the business 
value analysis at the end.
